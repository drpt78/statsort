## Overview & Motivation

Standard sorting algorithms such as `std::sort` operate by comparing elements, achieving O(n log n) average complexity regardless of the data distribution. However, in many real-world applications — scientific computing, financial data processing, signal processing, and simulation pipelines — data is drawn from smooth, well-behaved distributions such as uniform, Gaussian, or exponential.

For these cases, comparison-based sorting discards valuable information: we often know *approximately* where an element belongs before we even look at its neighbors. `statsort` exploits this by using element values directly to guide placement, achieving **O(n log log n) average complexity** on smooth distributions — a meaningful asymptotic and practical improvement over `std::sort`.

**Typical use cases:**
- Sorting large floating-point datasets from physics or fluid simulations
- Pre-processing numeric data before statistical analysis
- Financial time-series sorting where values cluster around known ranges
- Any pipeline handling large arithmetic datasets with approximately smooth distributions

`statsort` is not intended for integer keys with many duplicates, adversarial inputs, or nearly-sorted data, where `std::sort` or a radix-based approach remains preferable.

## Algorithm Description

The core idea is straightforward: instead of comparing elements, use their values to place them into one of **√n buckets** via linear interpolation, then recurse within each bucket.

### Key insight: variable bucket count

Most distribution-based sorting algorithms (e.g. bucket sort) use a fixed number of buckets, giving O(log n) recursion depth. By using **√n buckets** — scaling with input size — `statsort` reduces recursion depth to **O(log log n)**, which is the source of its asymptotic advantage.

### Step-by-step

1. Compute the minimum and maximum of the input range.
2. Allocate √n buckets and distribute elements using linear interpolation:
   ```
   bucket_index = floor((value - min) / (max - min) * sqrt(n))
   ```
3. Recurse into each non-trivial bucket.
4. Concatenate buckets to produce the sorted output.

### Fallback behavior

On adversarial or highly skewed inputs, bucket imbalance can degrade performance toward O(n²). To prevent this, `statsort` monitors bucket sizes during distribution and falls back to `std::sort` when imbalance is detected, guaranteeing safe worst-case behavior.

### Complexity summary

| Case | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Average (smooth distributions) | O(n log log n) | O(√n) |
| Worst case (adversarial input) | O(n log n) (fallback) | O(log n) |

## Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks were run on GCC -O3, x86-64 Linux, comparing `statsort` against `std::sort`.

| Input Size  Distribution | `std::sort` | `statsort` | Speedup |
|------------------------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Uniform  n=100000                  |       36.07 ms |       19.40 ms |     1.86x |
| Gaussian  n=100000                 |       35.71 ms |       19.48 ms |     1.83x |
| Exponential  n=100000              |       35.58 ms |       19.07 ms |     1.87x |
| Nearly sorted  n=100000            |       16.29 ms |       18.86 ms |     0.86x |
